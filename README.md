## About <a name = "about"></a>

Just a project for me to experiment a bit with some vanilla JS, HTML and SCSS. I've been using JS frameworks for a while now and have not yet taken a step back to see what I've learned. So see this project as a challenge for myself, to create different functions or styles with just vanilla JS and SCSS.

Maybe further down the line I will add some other packages and expand the JS functionality with libraries. TBH I'll just do whatever I feel like ;P

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- You need NodeJS installed to use NPM.
- Install yarn with `npm install -g yarn`

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1. First you need to clone this project to you local machine.
2. After that you should run `yarn` in the root of the project; to install all the needed packages.
3. If everything is installed, run `yarn watch` to make sure the `.SCSS` files get compiled to `.CSS`.
4. If you are not keeping this code on a development server, make sure to [install live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). This will allow you to auto refresh the html pages on a code change.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Just have fun, try some experiments for yourself. I'm not going to handle PR's or issues because this project is not intended to be used that way.
